Today I started configuring my new MacBook Pro.  In this blog post I will document the applications I've installed and the configuration changes I make.

## Step one

- Install Homebrew

The first application I install on a new OS installation is HomeBrew.  Homebrew is the most popular package manager for MacOS. It's a clean and easy way to install the applications you need. Similar to the Windows alternative Chocolately. 

Visit [brew.sh](https://brew.sh), copy the install command and run in your macOS Terminal.

## Step two

Now that I have Homebrew installed I can easily search and install my required applications.

brew search "application name"

brew install "application name"

- Install LastPass
- Install vscode
- Install Spotify 
- Install Microsoft Office
